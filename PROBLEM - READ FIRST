Billy Suds is planning to build another location for their successful chain of car washes:
“Sudsational Car Wash”. They are wondering how many self-service car wash bays to build. Consider the
following:
 Billy expects 80 customers an hour on average, all day (they open for 12 hours),
every day (365 days a year), at their new location. Assume arrivals are Poisson
(exponential inter-arrival times).
 Customers wash their own cars, which takes between 4 to 8 minutes. Assume
service times are discrete uniform, between 4 to 8 minutes inclusive.
 The cost of each additional bay is about $10,000 a year in annualized fixed and
operating costs.
 Billy knows that customers hate to wait, but think they are ok to wait a bit. So
assume that for every minute AFTER 10 minutes that the whole process takes
(including wait time and car wash time), costs $2 per minute per car in loss of
goodwill.
Simulate the car wash in Python or Excel. Create a reasonable number of customers and/or replications,
and justify your choice. Then answer the following in a short report:
Q1) How many customers and/or replications did you choose? How did you decide on these values?
Q2) What is the optimal number of car wash bays to build to minimize the total annual cost of the car
wash queueing system?
Q3) Make a chart to show your answer to Q2 clearly.
Next, try to simulate a more realistic system with busy and less busy periods. Suppose that for 3 hours a
day, the rate of arrivals is 200 customers per hour, and for the other 9 hours a day the arrival rate is only
40 customers per hour.
Q4) How does your answer change under these new conditions?
